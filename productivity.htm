						<td>macOS</td>

							Great application support, can handle remote desktops, virtual

							editing.

					<tr>
						<td>Windows</td>
						<td>
							Magnificent application support with a global standard of being
							able to handle anything work related.
						</td>
						<td>Around $100</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Chrome OS</td>
						<td>
							Capable of performing basic to intermediate tasks such as
							accessing emails, managing office suites, and handling common
							coursework, though it may be insufficent for more advanced
							operations (e.g. building a website).

					<tr>
						<td>MacBook</td>
						<td>
							Portable models like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro will be good
							for needs like virtual desktops and video editing respectively.
							For more intense video editing, consider a higher-end MacBook Pro
							upon purchasing.
						</td>
						<td>Starting at $999</td>
						<td>
							Apple M1 Chip, 8GB RAM for lighter stuff, 16GB RAM for heavier
							workloads
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>iMac</td>
						<td>
							This all-in-one desktop is ideal for workflows while needing to
							engage in conference calls and web meetings as it has a built-in
							microphone and webcam.
						</td>
						<td>Starting at $1,299</td>
						<td>
							Apple M1 Chip, 8GB RAM for lighter stuff, 16GB RAM for heavier
							workloads

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Mac</td>
						<td>
							A naturally headless Mac machine like the Mac Mini, Mac Studio and
							Mac Pro that needs to be connected to an external monitor, mouse,
							and keyboard is for the most efficient workflows where the most
							juice is needed.
						</td>
						<td>Starting at $699</td>

							Apple M1 Pro chip and 16GB RAM for lighter stuff, at least Apple
							M1 Max chip and at least 32GB RAM for heavier workloads
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Windows laptop</td>
						<td>
							A solid recommendation for intermediate workloads if you do not
							have enough space for a full desktop. Also, consider keeping the
							charger nearby and in a cool temperature since these tend to get
							hot.
						</td>
						<td>*At least $549</td>

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Prebuilt Windows PC</td>
						<td>
							A naturally headless Windows machine that needs to be connected to
							an external monitor, mouse, and keyboard is for more efficient
							workflows where more juice is needed. Unlike Macs, some parts are
							usually upgradable should any more power be needed.

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Windows All-In-One PC</td>
						<td>
							For a more compact, fixed desktop space, these devices will be

							communication.
						</td>
						<td>*At least $799</td>
						<td>Intel i5 and 16GB RAM</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Chromebook</td>
						<td>
							Sometimes less can be more and the Chromebook is just that. If you
							live on campus or you prefer working in portable workspaces and
							you don't need much out of your computer other than the ordinary,
							Chromebook is your best bet.
